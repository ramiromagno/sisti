Description: This data package contains four datasets of quantitative PCR (qPCR)
  amplification curves that were used as supplementary data in the research
  article by Sisti et al. (2010), <doi:10.1186/1471-2105-11-186>.
  The primary dataset comprises a ten-fold dilution series spanning
  copy numbers from 3.14 × 10^7 to 3.14 × 10^2, with twelve replicates per
  concentration. These samples are based on a pGEM-T Promega plasmid containing
  a 104 bp fragment of the mitochondrial gene NADH dehydrogenase 1 (MT-ND1),
  amplified using the ND1/ND2 primer pair. The remaining three datasets contain
  qPCR results in the presence of specific PCR inhibitors: tannic acid,
  Immunoglobulin G (IgG), and quercetin, respectively, to assess their effects
  on the amplification process. These datasets are useful for researchers 
  interested in PCR kinetics. The original raw data file is available as
